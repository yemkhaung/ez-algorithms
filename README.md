# A Somewhat Easy Way to Look At Algorithms

I got a lot of clarity regarding data structures and algorithms after reading [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Y. Bhargva. And thought of summarized, quick content in a way that future  revisiting of the contents should be at a glance without having to reread the entire book or whole chapters.

This repo is intended to review algorithms and data structures by using ways that I understood the most easy and naturally simple for me from the [book](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms). Feel free to reuse or distribute or do whatever you want.
